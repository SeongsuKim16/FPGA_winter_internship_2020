Memory circuits with sequential logics are included.

SR latch (made with two NOR gates)
D latch (made with two AND gates and a SR latch)
D flipflop (made with two D latches)
D flipflop optimized (made by Verilog HDL's synthesizer)
Enable D flipflop (made with a 2 to 1 MUX and D flipflop)
Enable D flipflop optimized (made by Verilog HDL's synthesizer. version 1 used ternary operater(non blocking) and version 2 used ifelse logic(blocking))
Resettable D flipflop of 4 bit bus size (made by Verilog HDL's synthesizer)
